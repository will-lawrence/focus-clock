# Pomodoro Clock

"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student."

This project creates a desktop widget that can be used to work in a pomodoro method. Simple and to the point, the program will tell you when to stay focused and when to have a break.

Built in Python with the Tkinter library. 

# 25 Minutes of work + 5 Minutes of Break!
